# Malay-word-prediction-model
This project employs deep learning to create a Malay word prediction model. A word2vec model is build and the best model at the end of epoch is saved.

The objective is to forecast the succeeding Malay word (wordn+1) based on a sequence of n preceding words (wordi+1, wordi+2, ..., wordi+n). The model undergoes training with a dataset encompassing both training and validation data, and its effectiveness is assessed using an independent test dataset.
